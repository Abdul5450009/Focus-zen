# Focus-zen
ðŸ’» Just finished building a fully responsive landing page for a fictional productivity app called FocusZen â€” designed entirely by me, including the color scheme, blur effects, and interactive particle background.

ðŸ§˜ Itâ€™s simple, fast, mobile-ready, and coded with just HTML & CSS â€” no libraries, no frameworks.

ðŸŽ¯ This is a big personal win because a few months ago, I couldnâ€™t even imagine making this. Today, I made it from scratch. Alhamdulillah.

Feedback always welcome. ðŸ™Œ
